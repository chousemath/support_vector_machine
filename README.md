### Sample Support Vector Machine

* A support vector machine is a classification technique
* A support vector machine is, at the end of the day, a model that best splits clusters of data
* SVMs are good at dealing with high-dimensional data, and works well on small datasets
* The distance between the data points and the svm model should be as wide as possible
* The points are called support vectors, and the `line` generated by the model is called the hyperplane
* Need to normalize the data

### What is the C Parameter?

* The C parameter tells the SVM optimization how much you want to avoid misclassifying each training example.
* For large values of C, the optimization will choose a smaller-margin hyperplane if that hyperplane does a better job of getting all the training points classified correctly.
* Conversely, a very small value of C will cause the optimizer to look for a larger-margin separating hyperplane, even if that hyperplane misclassifies more points.
* For very tiny values of C, you should get misclassified examples, often even if your training data is linearly separable.

### Relevant Mathematical Concepts

* Constrained optimization
* Lagrange multipliers
